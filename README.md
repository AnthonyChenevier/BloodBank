BLOOD BANK: Transfusions for your colonists
===========================================
WARNING: NOT YET FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION

Adds a "Blood Pack" item that can be used to counter the effects of blood loss after injury.
	
Blood packs are created using the "Extract some blood" operation on humanlikes, and can be used directly by any pawn (like a serum) or applied with the "Give blood transfusion" operation by a doctor. 
Both of the operations and using a blood pack directly require a medical skill of at least 4, and have no failure chance at this point (TBD).
Blood has a short shelf-life (12hrs) so must be frozen if you plan on keeping a stockpile for any amount of time. 
Blood types are not important for the same reason that you can happily transplant organs without immunosuppresents in Rimworld - future human evolution/medicine/don't think about it :P

Extracting blood will reduce the donor's blood by 20%, and is considered a violation on pawns from other factions, so you Warboys* will have to deal with negative faction relations if you try to make your own Tom Hardy (currently no negtive thought for the prisoner itelf though, TBD ). Taking blood from a pawn who already has extreme blood loss can kill them, so if you want to keep them alive only perform this operation on pawns with Blood Loss (Severe) or less.
	
Transfusing blood is not perfect and only restores up to 10% of blood lost, so you will need 2x as many blood packs to restore the same amount of blood taken. 
	
Future plans:
	- Custom settings page for transfusion efficiency and skill requirements
	- Failure chances -  a cut on the arm for a minor botched attempt, maybe up to poking out an eye for ridiculous, but I'm not too sold on making this dangerous.
	- Small chance of minor diesease: Transfusion Rejection - Basically just food poisoning in effect, to represent increased (but not perfect) blood type compatibility in Rimworld's humans
	- Alien Framework Compatibility (alien blood != human blood for transfusions, extra blood products from exotic blood (maybe))
	- Automatic job for doctors to apply emergency blood transfusions to patients with extreme blood loss if blood packs are available, like tending wounds.
	
This is my first (public) mod. I searched for something similar when I was frustrated by pawns taking so long to heal back to a productive state after big fights and nothing came up, so here we are :) I hope you enjoy. As you can see I plan on extending this a fair bit, but it may take a little while as I'm still learning the engine.
	
*Warboys and doofwarriors not included, but now I kinda want them... ahem watch this space.
